# Outlook Live A11y

This is a new project.

- Project working name: Outlook Live A11y
- Project alias: Ola

## Goal

Make Microsoft's Outlook web application more accessible for persons with low vision.

## Strategy

Use the _[Witchcraft CSS/JS injector](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/witchcraft-jscss-injector/hokcepcfcicnhalinladgknhaljndhpc)_ Chrome extension to modify the code received from the server before displaying it in the user's browser.

Please see the extension's [GitHub repository](https://github.com/luciopaiva/witchcraft) and [Home page](https://luciopaiva.com/witchcraft/) for more information on its features, functionality and usage.

## Assets

Ola created a dummy Outlook.live account for testing and development purposes. Then (on the page that displays when Outlook initially loads ) it cleaned up the Inbox so that it contains a single email. You can find the source code for this page [here](./public/assets/initial-page-source.txt).
